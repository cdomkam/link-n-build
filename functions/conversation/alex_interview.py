  "Impressive results! Can you tell me about a time when a campaign didn’t go as planned? How did you handle it?",

  "That’s great to hear. Now, tell me why you’re interested in working with us specifically?",
  "Thank you, Alex. That’s very insightful. Do you have any questions for me about the role or our company?",
  "Certainly. You’d be joining a dynamic team that’s currently working on a major rebranding initiative and expanding our digital presence. We’re also exploring new content strategies to engage with a younger audience. You’d have the chance to collaborate with cross-functional teams and bring your own ideas to the table.",

  "Good morning! I’m doing well, thank you. I’m excited to be here.",
  "At my previous job, I led a campaign to promote a new product line. We developed a multi-channel strategy that included social media ads, influencer partnerships, and email marketing. I set up specific KPIs such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and ROI. We used A/B testing to refine our messaging and targeted different customer segments based on their behavior. The campaign ended up increasing our product line sales by 25% and significantly boosted our brand’s online presence.",
  "There was one campaign where we launched a new feature for our app, but it didn’t resonate as we expected. The engagement rates were lower than anticipated. We quickly pivoted by analyzing user feedback and A/B testing alternative approaches. We found that the messaging was too technical for our target audience, so we simplified it and emphasized the feature’s benefits. We also increased our retargeting efforts. Within a few weeks, we saw a significant improvement in engagement and conversions.",
  "I’m passionate about continuous learning. I subscribe to several industry newsletters and follow thought leaders on social media. I also attend webinars and workshops whenever possible. Recently, I completed a certification in Google Analytics to deepen my understanding of data analysis. Additionally, I enjoy participating in marketing communities and forums to exchange ideas and stay informed about emerging trends.",
  "I’ve been following your company’s growth for a while, and I’m really impressed by your innovative approach to marketing and your commitment to sustainability. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team that values creativity and has a strong vision for the future. I believe my skills and experience align well with your current needs, and I’m enthusiastic about the chance to bring fresh ideas to your campaigns.",
  "Yes, I do. Can you tell me more about the team I’d be working with and the types of projects they’re currently focused on?",
  "That sounds fantastic. I’m really excited about the possibility of contributing to those projects.",
  "Thank you for having me. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to hearing from you.",
  "You too!"
